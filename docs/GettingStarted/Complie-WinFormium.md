# Compile WinFormium

## Overview

WinFormium Framework uses the latest SDK style project structure, so you should use Visual Studio 2022 to open the solution file `WinFormium.sln`. The source code of the framework is located in the `src` folder, where you can find all the source code.

## Prepare to compile

The target frameworks supported by WinFormium projects by default are:

- .NET Framework 4.6.2
- .NET Framework 4.7/4.7.1/4.7.2
- .NET Framework 4.8/4.8.1
- .NET 6.0/7.0

Therefore, you need to install the corresponding .NET Framework SDK and .NET SDK, otherwise the compilation will fail. Of course, you can also modify the project file to change the target framework and delete unnecessary target frameworks.

## Compile

After preparing Visual Studio 2022 and the corresponding .NET Framework SDK and .NET SDK, you can open the `WinFormium.sln` solution file and compile the WinFormium framework. If nothing else, you will get a successful compilation result.
